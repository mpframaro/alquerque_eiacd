# Alquerque

This project was done for a first year curricular unit (Elementos de Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados).

Using Python I developed a variant of the alquerque board game!<br>
Further rules about the game can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque

This was the first time developing a project of this sort, and was done to experiment with PyGame and algorithms.<br>
In all modes, the PC uses the minimax algorithm, which I implemented; and PyGame was used for a GUI.<br>
The following game modes are avaiable:
- Human vs Human
- Human vs PC
- PC vs PC
