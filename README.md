# Alquerque

This project was done for a first year curricular unit (Elementos de Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados).
It was the first time experimenting with PyGame.

Using Python I developed a variant of the alquerque board game!

PyGame was used for a GUI that allows for the following game modes:
- Human vs Human
- Human vs PC
- PC vs PC

In all modes, the PC uses the minimax algorithm, which I implemented.

Further rules about the game can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque
